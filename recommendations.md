## Tymon Recommendation List

**Waterloo Area**

- **Leake Street Arches** - London’s Longest Legal graffiti wall. Usually see artists working there live too. By Waterloo Station

- **Scootercaffe** - my favourite coffee shop in Waterloo. Lower Marsh.

- **Florence Nightingale Museum** - modern nursing exhibit, didn’t think it would be my thing - really enjoyed it in the end.

### West London

- **Biggest Star Wars Fan Exhibition**: I mean this is just really cool, hope your daughter is a nerd too :D https://fansstrikebackexhibition.com/london/?utm_content=things-to-do-london-june&utm_source=secretldn&utm_medium=post&utm_term=cta4

- **Primrose Hill** - voted most scenic view of the whole capital. 

### Central (Strand) London

**Somerset House** - relieve where Tymon studied at university! (Or alternatively, just see the really cool London Design Biennale) - everything from culture of bread making to Kyoto past and future in VR: https://londondesignbiennale.com/

If you go deeper into Strand and Kings College, it’s a super new area that was only constructed recently and completely pedestrianised which I love. Google Bush House.

- **Top Secret Comedy Club** - tickets start from £1 and on the stand up nights, there’s usually always some famous comedian that comes (the most famous comedians try content out here) https://thetopsecretcomedyclub.co.uk/ 

- **Neals Yard** - a tiny village like, inside Covent Garden? Nice n secret and interesting rather unique.

### South of the River (London Bridge)

- **Morocco Bound Cafe**: my favourite place on earth, have a look on Instagram for what events they have on, but it’s also just nice to get a coffee or a weird beer on beautiful Bermondsey Street. 

- **Butlers Wharf**: nice and quiet and non-touristy view of Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf. Super pretty and nowhere near as busy as by Council Building.

- **Guys Campus** has a few film scenes filmed there - really pretty campus, nice for a wonder around.

- **Lord Nelson pub** - NOT FOR FOOD!!!! VERY CLASSIC PUB FOOD I.E sadly lots of meat HOWEVER super unique decorated pub and unique vibe.

- **Oxo Tower shops** - lots of unique shops including a super fun quirky gift shop. Nice to stop by as you go along the river.

- **Hayward Gallery** - probably my favourite pop up exhibition place. From 1 Jun they have the Union Jill exhibit all about a take on the Union Jack in face of environmental protest.

### North of Tower Bridge

- **Immersive Van Gough Exhibit**: some people say this is amazing, some say “I just paid £15 to stand in low res van Gough” - either way pretty cool https://vangoghexpo.com/london/ 

- **GreatArt London** nice art shop that I go to usually - like most semibig art shops so I’d only go if you’re in Shoreditch already. 

- **Columbia Road Flower Market**: Open only Sunday mornings and empty. Very pretty but too busy for me usually but maybe you don’t mind !

- **The Garden at 120**: Great free view of London skyline - right next to Leadenhall Market, where they filmed Harry Potter. Also, did you know you could go UP the Monument at Monument station? 

- **The Sky Garden**: nature in the sky! https://skygarden.london/ 

### Hackney

- **The last curiosities museum** - The Viktor Wynd Museum Of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History

- **The Spread Eagle** - London's first fully vegan pub
